## How to use



<div class="tabs-box" markdown="1">
{% include programmingLanguageSelectScalaPythonNLU.html %}
```python
pipeline_local = PretrainedPipeline('match_datetime')
result = pipeline_local.annotate("David visited the restaurant yesterday with his family. He also visited and the day before, but at that time he was alone. David again visited today with his colleagues. He and his friends really liked the food and hoped to visit again tomorrow.")

tres = pipeline_local.fullAnnotate(input_list)[0]
for dte in tres['date']:
    sent = tres['sentence'][int(dte.metadata['sentence'])]
    print (f'text/chunk {sent.result[dte.begin:dte.end+1]} | mapped_date: {dte.result}')
```
```scala
import com.johnsnowlabs.nlp.pretrained.PretrainedPipeline import com.johnsnowlabs.nlp.SparkNLP

SparkNLP.version()

input_list = [
    """David visited the restaurant yesterday with his family. 
He also visited and the day before, but at that time he was alone.
David again visited today with his colleagues.
He and his friends really liked the food and hoped to visit again tomorrow.""",]

val testData = spark.createDataFrame(Seq( (1, input_list) )).toDF("id", "text")

val pipeline = PretrainedPipeline("match_datetime", lang="en")

val annotation = pipeline.transform(testData)

annotation.show()
```
</div>

## Results

```bash
text/chunk yesterday | mapped_date: 2022/01/02
text/chunk  day before | mapped_date: 2022/01/02
text/chunk today | mapped_date: 2022/01/03
text/chunk tomorrow | mapped_date: 2022/01/04
